# Dashboard API integration reference

This document catalogues every backend endpoint the AgentPay dashboard calls, with
the exact request body and the response shape the UI expects. Shapes are derived
from `src/lib/apiClient.ts` and the inline TypeScript declarations in each page —
**every shape below matches the code at the cited source.**

All requests go through the lightweight `fetch` wrapper in
[`src/lib/apiClient.ts`](../src/lib/apiClient.ts) (reads are usually issued via the
[`useApi`](../src/lib/useApi.ts) hook). Two call sites — the usage **Record** and
**Query** forms in [`src/app/usage/page.tsx`](../src/app/usage/page.tsx) — use raw
`fetch` directly but follow the same JSON conventions.

## Transport conventions

| Concern | Behaviour | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base URL | `API_BASE` resolved once at module load via `resolveApiBase()`; every path is `${API_BASE}${path}` | `apiClient.ts`, `resolveApiBase.ts` |
| Request headers | `Content-Type: application/json` is sent by default (callers may override) | `apiClient.ts` |
| Request body | `apiPost`/`apiPatch` `JSON.stringify` the supplied object | `apiClient.ts` |
| Empty response | HTTP **204** resolves to `undefined` (no body parsed) | `apiClient.ts` |
| Timeout | Default **10 000 ms**; on expiry the call rejects with `ApiTimeoutError` | `apiClient.ts` |
| Success | 2xx JSON body is returned as the generic `T` | `apiClient.ts` |
| GET deduplication | `apiGet` deduplicates in-flight GET requests by resolved URL; a single network fetch serves all concurrent callers. Entries are evicted on settle (success or error) so no stale data is served. Caller abort signals are not wired to the shared request — aborting one subscriber does not cancel the fetch for others. | `apiClient.ts` |

### Timeout and Error Handling

Calls timing out after the default **10 000 ms** reject with an `ApiTimeoutError`. The `useApi` hook detects `ApiTimeoutError` instances and exposes a distinct error kind (`errorKind: "timeout"`, `isTimeout: true`) along with a user-facing timeout message (`"Request timed out. Please try again."`) and a `retry()` callback affordance rather than flattening it into a generic HTTP failure.

### Error envelope (`ApiError`)

Non-2xx responses are expected to carry this JSON envelope; the wrapper throws an
`Error` whose `message` (and `error`/`requestId`) come from it:

```ts
type ApiError = {
  error: string;       // machine-readable code, e.g. "validation_error"
  message: string;     // human-readable; surfaced in the UI
  requestId?: string;  // optional correlation id
};
```

If the body is missing/!ok, the wrapper falls back to `error: "http_error"` and a
`Request failed with status <code>` message.

### GET request deduplication

Concurrent `apiGet` calls to the same resolved URL share a single in-flight fetch.
The first call triggers the network request; subsequent callers receive the same
pending promise. Once the promise settles (fulfilled or rejected) the cache entry
is removed so the next call always gets fresh data.

Caller `AbortSignal` instances are **not** forwarded to the shared underlying
`fetch` — aborting one subscriber does not cancel the request for others,
preventing a component unmount from disrupting another component's data.

Non-idempotent methods (`POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) are never deduplicated;
`apiFetch` called directly is also unaffected.

### Pause flag

A global pause flag is exposed by `GET /api/v1/admin/status` (`{ paused }`) and
`GET /api/v1/stats` (`paused`), and toggled from the Admin page via
`POST /api/v1/admin/pause` / `POST /api/v1/admin/unpause`. **While paused the
backend refuses writes** (the Stats page surfaces "writes are refused"). In the
tables below, **Write** rows are the mutating calls subject to this flag; **Read**
rows are always available.

## Services

| Method & path | Type | Request body | Response shape | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/services?page={page}&limit={limit}` | Read | — | `{ services?: Service[]; items?: Service[]; page?: number; pageCount?: number }` (UI reads `services ?? items`) | `services/page.tsx` |
| `GET /api/v1/services?q={query}&limit={limit}` | Read | — | `{ services: Service[] }` | `search/page.tsx` |
| `POST /api/v1/services` | Write | `{ serviceId: string; priceStroops: number }` | response ignored by UI | `services/new/page.tsx` |
| `GET /api/v1/services/{serviceId}` | Read | — | `Service` | `services/[serviceId]/page.tsx`, `.../edit/page.tsx` |
| `PATCH /api/v1/services/{serviceId}/price` | Write | `{ priceStroops: number }` | response ignored by UI | `services/[serviceId]/edit/page.tsx` |
| `GET /api/v1/services/{serviceId}/usage` | Read | — | `Rollup` | `services/[serviceId]/page.tsx` |
| `GET /api/v1/services/{serviceId}/agents/top?limit={limit}` | Read | — | `TopAgents` | `services/[serviceId]/agents/page.tsx` |

```ts
type Service   = { serviceId: string; priceStroops: number };
type Rollup    = { serviceId: string; total: number; agents: number };
type TopAgents = { serviceId: string; items: { agent: string; total: number }[] };
```

> **Client-side validation**: `priceStroops` is parsed by `parseNonNegativeInt` in
> [`src/lib/validateNumber.ts`](../src/lib/validateNumber.ts), which rejects values
> outside `0 … 9,007,199,254,740,991` (`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`), exponent notation
> (e.g. `"1e2"`), and whitespace-padded input. The accepted range is shown as a field
> hint on both the create (`services/new`) and edit (`services/[serviceId]/edit`) forms.

### Optimistic service price mutations

Price edits use the service-scoped optimistic ledger in
[`src/lib/serviceOptimisticStore.ts`](../src/lib/serviceOptimisticStore.ts).
The edited price is published to subscribed dashboard/detail consumers before the
PATCH resolves. Each service has an independent monotonic mutation revision and
network queue: same-service PATCH + reconciliation pairs execute in submit order,
so an older write cannot land after a newer one and leave server state behind the
newer UI. Queues are independent across services, so unrelated updates still run
concurrently.

A successful PATCH is followed by a canonical
`GET /api/v1/services/{serviceId}`; that response reconciles the optimistic
entry. If the write fails, only that mutation revision is removed, revealing the
exact previous canonical value (or the next-newest pending edit). Write failures
surface the stable `SERVICE_WRITE_FAILED` code with a user-safe message, and
the edit form announces the rollback through an `aria-live="polite"` status
region. A write that succeeds but cannot be reconciled is distinguished as
`SERVICE_RECONCILE_FAILED`; the optimistic value is retained because the
server write already succeeded.


## Usage

| Method & path | Type | Request body | Response shape | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/v1/usage` | Write | `{ agent: string; serviceId: string; requests: number }` | `{ total: number }` | `usage/page.tsx` (raw `fetch`) |
| `GET /api/v1/usage/{agent}/{serviceId}` | Read | — | `{ agent: string; serviceId: string; total: number }` | `usage/page.tsx` (raw `fetch`) |
| `GET /api/v1/usage/export.json` | Read | — | file download (JSON), opened via `<a href>` | `export/ExportActions.tsx` |
| `GET /api/v1/usage/export.csv` | Read | — | file download (CSV), opened via `<a href>` | `export/ExportActions.tsx` |

Both export endpoints accept optional query parameters for date-range filtering:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `startDate` | `string` (ISO date, e.g. `2025-01-01`) | Inclusive start of the date range |
| `endDate` | `string` (ISO date, e.g. `2025-12-31`) | Inclusive end of the date range |

Example: `GET /api/v1/usage/export.json?startDate=2025-01-01&endDate=2025-01-31`

The UI defaults to the current month and provides quick presets for the last 7 and 30 days.

## Stats

| Method & path | Type | Request body | Response shape | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/stats` | Read | — | `Stats` | `stats/page.tsx`, `agents/page.tsx` |

```ts
type Stats = {
  totalServices: number;
  totalApiKeys: number;
  totalRequests: number;
  uniqueAgents: number;
  paused: boolean;
};
```

## Agents

| Method & path | Type | Request body | Response shape | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/agents/{agent}/usage` | Read | — | `Usage` | `agents/[agent]/page.tsx` |
| `GET /api/v1/agents/{agent}/total` | Read | — | `{ total: number }` (optional; failure is ignored) | `agents/[agent]/page.tsx` |

```ts
type Usage = { agent: string; items: { serviceId: string; total: number }[] };
```

## Admin

| Method & path | Type | Request body | Response shape | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/status` | Read | — | `{ paused: boolean }` | `admin/page.tsx` |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/pause` | Write | `{}` | response ignored by UI | `admin/page.tsx` |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/unpause` | Write | `{}` | response ignored by UI | `admin/page.tsx` |

## API keys

| Method & path | Type | Request body | Response shape | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/api-keys` | Read | — | `{ items: KeyItem[] }` | `api-keys/page.tsx` |
| `POST /api/v1/api-keys` | Write | `{ label: string }` | `{ key: string }` (full key, shown once) | `api-keys/page.tsx` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/api-keys/{prefix}` | Write | — | 204 (no body) | `api-keys/page.tsx` |

```ts
type KeyItem = { prefix: string; label: string; createdAt: number };
```

## Webhooks

| Method & path | Type | Request body | Response shape | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/webhooks` | Read | — | `{ items: Webhook[] }` | `webhooks/page.tsx` |
| `POST /api/v1/webhooks` | Write | `{ url: string; events: string[] }` | response ignored by UI | `webhooks/page.tsx` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/webhooks/{id}` | Write | — | 204 (no body) | `webhooks/page.tsx` |

```ts
type Webhook = { id: string; url: string; events: string[]; createdAt: number };
```

## Events

| Method & path | Type | Request body | Response shape | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/events?limit={limit}` | Read | — | `{ items: AppEvent[] } \| { events: AppEvent[] }` | `events/page.tsx` |

```ts
type AppEvent = {
  id: string;
  ts: number | string | null;
  type: string;
  payload: Record<string, unknown>;
};
```

### CSV export (client-side)

The **Export CSV** button on the Events page does not call the backend — it
serialises the currently filtered `AppEvent[]` (the full filtered set, not
just the 50 rows rendered on screen) into an RFC 4180 CSV string entirely in
the browser and triggers a download via an object URL. Disabled while the
page is loading or the filtered set is empty. Columns: `id, timestamp, type,
payload` (`payload` is JSON-stringified). Each field is escaped:

- Values starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, a tab, or a carriage return are
  prefixed with `'` to defuse spreadsheet formula injection.
- Values containing a comma, double quote, or newline are wrapped in double
  quotes, with embedded quotes doubled.

The file is written with a UTF-8 byte-order mark so Excel opens it with the
correct character set. Source: `events/page.tsx` (`eventsToCsv`,
`escapeCsvField`, `downloadEventsCsv`).

## Changelog

| Method & path | Type | Request body | Response shape | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/changelog` | Read | — | `{ entries: Entry[] }` | `changelog/page.tsx` |

```ts
type Entry = { version: string; date: string; notes: string[] };
```

## OpenAPI

| Method & path | Type | Notes | Source |

| `GET /api/v1/openapi.json` | Read | Linked from the Docs page as the machine-readable spec | `docs/page.tsx` |

---

_Accuracy note: every request/response shape above was transcribed from the
TypeScript type passed to `apiGet`/`apiPost`/`apiPatch`/`useApi` (or the raw
`fetch` body) at the cited source file. If a page's inline type changes, update the
corresponding row here._
